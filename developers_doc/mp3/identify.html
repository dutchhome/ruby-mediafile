<p align="left">I didn't do any programming, but I think the
topic is of enough interest to feature this as a page on the main
site, rather than to relegate it to a one-line entry on my links
page. </p>

<p>How does one determine the identity of an mp3 encoder if he
doesn't have access to the original .wav file? Naoki Shibata
devised the following checklist which he <a
href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fr3mixfrm1.showMessage?topicID=161.topic&amp;index=6">posted
on the r3mix.net forum</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana,Arial">One can guess which
    encoder is used using MP3 frame analyzer.<br>
    <br>
    Regarding CBR 128kbps MP3 files : <br>
    <br>
    Start from 0.<br>
    <br>
    0 : Are short blocks used? no -&gt; 1, yes -&gt; 3<br>
    1 : Are IS frames used? no -&gt; 2, yes -&gt; very old Xing<br>
    2 : Is scfsi used? no -&gt; old Xing, yes -&gt; new Xing<br>
    3 : Is the bit reseroir properly used? yes -&gt; 4, no -&gt;
    bladeenc<br>
    4 : Is scfsi used? no -&gt; 5, yes -&gt; lame(recent lame
    also uses scalefac_scale)<br>
    5 : Is scalefac_scale used? yes-&gt;6, no-&gt; unknown<br>
    6 : Is padding used? no -&gt; FhG(ACM or producer) yes -&gt;
    FhG(l3enc, fastenc or mp3enc)</font></p>

<p>[Note: It is important to note that this algorithm is
specified at CBR 128 kbit/s. FhG uses intensity stereo at lower
bitrates --ff123]</p>

<p>Naoki wrote a command-line program, which can be obtained from
his website, <a
href="http://www.milky.ne.jp/%257Egalaxy/mp3guessenc.html">http://www.milky.ne.jp/%7Egalaxy/mp3guessenc.html</a></p>

<p>jondee314 incorporated Naoki's code into a program which uses
a Windows Explorer-like interface. You can download his program
from his website, <a href="http://www.guerillasoft.com/Encspot/">http://www.guerillasoft.com/Encspot/</a></p>

<p>Gabriel Bouvigne suggested the following identifiers <a
href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fr3mixfrm1.showMessage?topicID=302.topic">in
this thread</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana,Arial">First of all, I
    personnally think that this detection thing is really nice.
    I'd also like to see the extented info provided by Naoki's
    code into an &quot;advanced info&quot; tab in the mad plugin.
    (Rob, what do you think about it?)<br>
    <br>
    I have a few suggestions for the detection thing:<br>
    <br>
    *try displaying a version number instead of just &quot;old&quot;.
    As an example, when we have a Lame file but the string &quot;LAME&quot;
    isn't found, the result could be &quot;Lame &lt;3.80&quot;
    instead of &quot;Lame (old)&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    *if there are no short blocks and the file is dual channel,
    the encoder is probably Shine. (yes, it's not so widespread,
    but it exists)<br>
    <br>
    *if no joint and all CRC are false, Blade<br>
    <br>
    *in the case of FhG, perhaps the original and copyright flags
    could be used to choose between the FhG flavours<br>
    <br>
    *FhG's vbr header includes the string &quot;VBRI&quot;<br>
    <br>
    *I remember seeing somewhere that padding of ancilary data (probably
    in the first and last frame) could also be used in order to
    determine the encoder (padding with 0 or F), but it's
    probably not very reliable.<br>
    <br>
    *With Lame, when using vbr and the vbr header is present, the
    Lame version number is always fully present in this vbr
    header. So it would be better to use this one ot extract Lame
    version instead of using the last one. It would speed up the
    process, and prevent a few &quot;Lame .TAG&quot; guessed
    version numbers because the last one was used and there
    wasn't enough space to put the version number in the last
    frame.</font></p>

<p><strong>Other identifiers, most of them a lot more difficult
to incorporate into a program</strong>:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fraunhofer's MP3Enc and Alternate codecs occasionally
        have dropouts (see my page, <a href="dropouts.html">&quot;Dropouts&quot;
        in FhG mp3enc/Alternate Codecs</a>). It is tedious to go
        through a file searching for dropouts, and the artifacts
        are not guaranteed to be present, but if you do see them,
        you can be virtually certain that MP3Enc or Alternate was
        used to encode the file.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">Addendum, 2-18-01</font>: QDesign's
    MVP 2.1 also seems to have dropouts when encoding BlackBird.wav.
    So I would amend the identification to choose MP3Enc/Alternate
    if Naoki's algorithm detects FhG and dropouts are present.
    Otherwise, if Naoki's algorithm detects dist10/other and
    dropouts are present, I would say it's QDesign's MVP.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fraunhofer's MP3Enc (not Alternate) can be identified at
        128 kbit/s, using the spectral view of your sound editor,
        by noting that frequencies never exceed 15 kHz. If
        someone has overridden the max bandwidth, you won't catch
        this, but if you do see this type of behavior, it's a
        sure bet you're looking at MP3Enc. For example, see the
        Cool Edit spectral view of Steely Dan's <em>Babylon
        Sisters</em>, below, encoded with MP3Enc31 -qual 9 at 128
        kbit/s:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3">
        <tr>
            <td>Codec</td>
            <td>Steely Dan's <em>Babylon Sisters</em></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>MP3Enc31<br>
            -qual 9, 128 kbit/s</td>

        </tr>
    </table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li>If an encoder is identified by Naoki's program as being
        FhG (l3enc, mp3enc, or fastenc), and it uses joint-stereo
        at a bitrate of 160 kbit/s or above, there is a good
        chance it is FastEnc, since mp3enc defaults to stereo for
        bitrates of 160 kbit/s and above, whereas FastEnc is
        forced to use joint-stereo for all bitrates.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Fraunhofer's bad Alternate codec (see <a
        href="alternbug.html">Bug in older FhG &quot;Alternate&quot;
        Codec</a>) can be identified, again by using the spectral
        view. Compare this plot with the one above for MP3Enc.
        The base cutoff is somewhere around 13 kHz instead of the
        normal 16 kHz (or 15 kHz for MP3Enc at 128 kbit/s). One
        has to be careful, though. If the music has quiet
        passages with not much high frequency content, it's
        possible to confuse this spectral plot with another. The
        key difference is that even with moderately loud passages
        containing high frequency content, which would normally
        be encoded by other codecs, the bad Alternate <em>still</em>
        cuts off at 13 kHz.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

            <td>Codec</td>
            <td>Steely Dan's <em>Babylon Sisters</em></td>

    <p>Compare the bad Alternate against FastEnc in the spectral
    views shown below, in which I have expanded the time scale.
    Near the middle portion of the plot, in moderately loud
    passages with high frequency content, using the FastEnc
    codec, energy is allowed up to 16 kHz. In the bad Alternate
    version, such passages are cut off at 13 kHz.</p>
